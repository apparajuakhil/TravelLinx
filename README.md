# Design Decision:

**Strategy design pattern.**
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. We have used strategy design pattern for the Dynamic pricing of rooms.We have considered different types of days that a customer or a user can book room like weekdays, weekends and Holidays.

**Chain of Responsibility design pattern**
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.Chain of Responsibility design pattern for booking the rooms. The rooms can be booked based on the userâ€™s choice.

**Singleton design pattern**
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.Singleton design pattern for the validation.
